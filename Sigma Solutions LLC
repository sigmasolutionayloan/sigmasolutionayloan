Comparing lenders and loan types can help you choose which working capital loan is best for your timeline and funding needs. Check each lender’s fees, interest rate and terms of repayment. You should also consider the application process, whether you have to have a business checking account, how fast you can get funding and how the lender handles customer support.

Lender requirements can vary. Ensure you understand the lender’s business loan eligibility requirements so you can prepare for the application process ahead of time.
