Your personal credit history is what lenders use to determine your ability to repay your debts. A personal credit score is a number between 350 and 850. The higher the number, the better your creditworthiness, which can help you qualify for more loans with better repayment terms.

You can use your personal credit to apply for open credit, like a cell phone plan, revolving credit on a credit card or installment credit, which can be student loans, a mortgage or a personal loan.

Many lenders will use your personal credit score for business credit, especially if your business is structured as a sole proprietorship or you’re a new business and don’t yet have a business credit score.
